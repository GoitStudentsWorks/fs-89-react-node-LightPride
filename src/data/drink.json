      "description": "Light rums, also referred to as \"silver\"or \"white\"rums, in general, have very little flavour aside from a general sweetness. Light rums are sometimes filtered after aging to remove any colour. The majority of light rums come from Puerto Rico. Their milder flavours make them popular for use in mixed drinks, as opposed to drinking them straight. Light rums are included in some of the most popular cocktails including the Mojito and the Daiquiri.",

      "instructions": "Fill a tall glass with ice. Layer the Finlandia Vodka, lemon and apple juices, Pisang Ambon, and top up with lemonade. Stir slightly and garnish with a spiralled cucumber skin and a red cherry. The cucumber provides zest and looks attractive. This drink, created by Timo Haimi, took first prize in the 1991 Finlandia Vodka Long Drink Competition."
